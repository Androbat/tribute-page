           <ul>
              <li><b>1642</b> - born in England. </li>
              <li><b>1661</b> - he was admitted to <br>Trinity College, Cambridge, on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough who had studied there.</li>
             
              <li><b>1687</b> - published his best book  "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics. Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and then using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the Solar System and demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles.</li>
             
             <li><b>1666</b> - Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years. From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism.</li>
             
             <li><b>1699</b> -Started the controvesy between Newton and Leibniz about who was the discoverer of calculus.  In 1699, other members of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud. </li>
             
               <li><b>1704</b> - Newton's work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, first published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid.</li>
             
              <li><b>1705</b> - was knighted by Queen Anne and spent the last three decades of his life in London,  serving as Warden.</p></li>
             
          <li><b>1727</b> - died in Kensington, London, United Kindom.</li>
